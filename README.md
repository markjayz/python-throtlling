Load Testing Script for API Endpoint\n
This Python script is designed to help you load test or test throttling settings on an API endpoint. It utilizes asynchronous programming with asyncio and aiohttp libraries to send multiple HTTP requests concurrently.

Prerequisites
Python 3 installed on your system
The following Python libraries installed:
asyncio
aiohttp
You can install these libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install asyncio aiohttp
Usage
Open the Python script load_test.py in your preferred text editor.
Update the script with your endpoint URL, payload, bearer token, and other parameters as needed.
Save the changes to the script.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python load_test.py
The script will start sending requests to the specified endpoint. You can adjust the number of requests and the time interval between requests in the script according to your testing requirements.

Script Parameters
base_url: The base URL of your API endpoint.
endpoint_path: The endpoint path to test.
payload: The sample payload to send in the request.
bearer_token: The bearer token for authentication.
num_requests: The number of requests to send.
interval: The time interval between each request (in seconds).
headers: Additional headers to include in the request.
Note
Ensure that your API endpoint is accessible and properly configured for testing.
Monitor the script execution and adjust parameters as needed to avoid overwhelming the endpoint or violating usage policies.
Use caution when load testing production systems to avoid causing disruptions or service degradation.
